Overview:

The TinyCrypt Library provides an implementation for constrained devices of a 
minimal set of standard cryptography primitives. 

Please, ***SEE THE DOCUMENTATION*** folder for more information on the supported 
cryptographic primitives and the limitations of TinyCrypt library. For usage,
security and technicalities, please see the corresponding header file of each 
cryptographic primitive. 

================================================================================

Organization:

/lib: C source code of the cryptographic primitives.
/lib/include/tinycrypt: C header files of the cryptographic primitives.
/tests: Test vectors of the cryptographic primitives.
/doc: Documentation of TinyCrypt. 

================================================================================

Building:

1) In CMakeLists.txt set: 
    - ENABLE_TESTS for enabling (true) or disabling (false) tests compilation.
2) mkdir build & cd build
3) cmake ..
4) cmake --build . --config Release
5) ctest -C Release
